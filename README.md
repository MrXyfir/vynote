# Abandoned

The code is old, ugly, poorly written, and contains a whole host of negative attributes that should make it of interest to no one. This project simply would have required too much work to get it to where I wanted. I'm uploading it so I can delete my local copy and hopefully never look at it again.

Do whatever you want with it, just don't expect any support or updates.
